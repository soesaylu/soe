Hello,

I'm writing to request that my 2nd-period class, Mr. Dorsch, be changed to a different one. The reason why I'm asking is that the overall atmosphere of the class will make it difficult for me to feel comfortable and satisfied in that environment. The number of people I'm friends with has noticeably decreased, and there is a rather high number of people that I will find hard to get along with. Because of this, I greatly believe switching to a different class would be beneficial for my well-being and academic experience, and for others around me.

Thank you for taking the time to read and consider my request.

Sincerely,
 Soe Say Lu
